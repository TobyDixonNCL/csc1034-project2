improvements:
    * Remove return i from for loops
    
Method of finding bugs:
    * Looking at runtime errors and checking to pointed to location within the project
    * Using pytest to set test cases to check all functions work
    * Using debugger to step through functions and check the values of variables to make sure
      they align with my predicted values.
